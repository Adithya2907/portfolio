Finally I'm able to get past my laziness and procrastinate to summon the courage to begin my very own portfolio site! It has been long awaited, nearly 3 years! 

Why a blog and portfolio site in the first place? 
<br />
Just to have a place to keep a record of the things I work on; the things I learn and that interest me; my ramblings so that many years down the line I can see how dumb I was!

What is this blog going to be about?
<br />
Anything and everything! Dev, tech, my experiences, travel, sports, finance, philosophy, etc! And a lot of positivity and hope!

Think of this as my scratchpad, where I jot down quick notes about new things I learn, or make a permanent record of the myriad of flickering thoughts I have in my turbluent mind. It's not going to be perfect, and neither am I going to make an effort to make it so! Just a way for me to have a presence, and hopefully help someone out there!

Hope you have a fun time here!

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
